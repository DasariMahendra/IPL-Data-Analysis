📌 Project Overview
This project is part of an IPL Data Analysis Case Study, where we explore real cricket match data to extract valuable insights, trends, and performance metrics across seasons. It combines data cleaning, transformation, statistical analysis, and visualization to simulate real-world data science tasks.It involves:

- 📂 Data Collection & Preprocessing (matches.csv & deliveries.csv)
- 🧹 Data Cleaning & Standardization using pandas
- 🔗 Data Merging & Aggregation for match and ball-level analysis
- 📊 Statistical Summaries & Grouping to extract insights
- 📈 Visual Analysis & Storytelling using matplotlib and seaborn
- 📎 Custom Metrics & KPIs like win %, economy rate, run rate
- 📉 Team & Player Insights with seasonal trends and comparisons
- 🏆 Business-like Recommendations for strategy, performance, and match-ups

## ✅ Task Simulations

This project includes answers to questions like:

### From `matches.csv`:
  ### Data Analysis:
  - Individual Player of match 
  - Number of times team won a final
  - Most Matches Won by a Team
  - Most Finals Won by a Team
  ### Data Visualizations:
  - Matches Played per Season
  - Most Successful Teams (Total Wins)
  - Toss Decision Breakdown
  - Toss Winner = Match Winner?
  - Top Venues by Number of Matches
  - Head-to-Head Match Counts Between Teams
  - Most Successful Teams in Finals 

### From `deliveries.csv`:
  ### Data Analysis:
  - Top Run Scorers
  - Top Wicket Takers
  - Most Sixes by a Player
  - Most Dot Balls Bowled by Bowler
  ### Data Visualizations:
  - Run Rate Over Seasons
  - Economy Rate of Bowlers
  - Over-by-Over Match progression
  - Dismissal type distribution
  - Powerplay vs Death overs stats
